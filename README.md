### Aditional Contents
As we all know the process of learning how to code or a new language is not only about the synthax or the functionality it has, it is also about everything that surrounds the language, like IDEs, linters, libraries, commands, configuration files, git, and a lot more. So for this the repository will contain information on those topics aswell.
